    BFF is used for development to provide a quick mock service  so the frontend 
    can be build and designed. This also helps to  provide a layer of abstraction 
    to the backend technology.  Another use of BFF is to provide a different 
    backend interfaces for different frontends.  i.e.: Android BFF, iOS BFF, 
    Web BFF etc.
