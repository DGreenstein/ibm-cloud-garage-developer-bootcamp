# Recommendations for Aftercare

* _**Participation in the Bluemix Garage Developer Bootcamp is not sufficient 
to begin practicing the method on live client engagements.**_

* _**We strongly recommend a subsequent internship with one of our World-Wide 
Garages.**_

* _**We've had great success in the past with bootcamp participants who shadowed 
a Garage client engagement for a period of 6-weeks.**_

* _**An individual's mileage may vary depending upon their inclination 
toward the practices and their ability as a quick study.**_

* _**New garage hires will be interned by their new teams.**_

* _**In lieu of an internship, it is our strong recommendation that client 
engagements be coached by an experienced garager.**_
